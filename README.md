# STARK HEALTH CLINIC - DIABETES PREDICTION
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Stark Health Clinic faces both medical and financial challenges due to diabetes. The clinic’s current early detection methods lack precision, leading to late diagnoses and missed opportunities for early intervention. This limits effective patient care and increases long-term costs. By applying advanced machine learning for risk prediction, the clinic can shift toward proactive, preventive healthcare.
